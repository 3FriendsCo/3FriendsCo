# Security Policy for Breaker Labs Projects

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our projects very seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our projects, please report it to us as follows:

- Email us at [pontus@henriksson.space](mailto:pontus@henriksson.space) with the subject "Security Vulnerability".
- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had the chance to address it.

## Security Audit

We periodically conduct security audits on our projects to find and fix vulnerabilities.

Thank you for helping to keep Breaker Labs and its users safe.
