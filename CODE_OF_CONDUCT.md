- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

These reports will be handled confidentially and shared only with the necessary members of the organization. If the behavior involves one of the maintainers listed below, please contact another maintainer for an unbiased review and appropriate action. We take all reports seriously and will never ignore such behavior, whether it comes from within our organization or from the community at large:
